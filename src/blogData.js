      itemCopy: 'I’ve always been a hardcore head, but unfortunately, I got into vintage late. Back in the day, we called them “OG’s” instead of vintage. “Just got an OG integrity shirt” not “just got a vintage integrity shirt. I’ve been around it since the dawn of time; all my friends had all the insane victory sleeve prints, test prints, <good> Youth of Today tees, but I could never cop at the time. Now that the bag has hit and I have become a corndog (a weenie with bread), there’s one shirt that’s always been on my mind: any Crumbsuckers tee. Crumbsuckers were a crossover band from New York with Chris from Krakdown on vocals. Very riff-heavy, mad solos, and very moshy. They cemented themselves as instant classics by dominating the cbgb matinee scene. Unfortunately, after their second studio album “Beast on My Back”, things went south and they broke up not too long after. They have played multiple reunions, their most recent being the 2015 Black n Blue Bowl, they sound immaculate. I was recently on a trip to Atlanta to see a long-time friend, I was having a hard time finding a vintage shop outside of a “general L train rip” etc. I went to one store, walked out, and walked up into the walkway/alley /promenade  and we saw a “curated vintage sign” and walked in, and my day was about to do a 180 from not being able to find anything crazy. I was able to grab the Life of  Dreams tee with an immaculate fade. It features artwork by Sean Taggart, the one behind all the crazy CBGB flyers, and an artwork contributor to bands such as Cro Mags, Underdog, and Carnivore. It’s very hard to find niche music tees at stores. Most of the time it’s either eBay or pray to the bin gods you can pull something. The previous store had a Snapcase tee for like 249, yikes. Being able to find something like this in a storefront is pretty sick because the guy asked me what into and I basically said “hardcore, shoegaze, skate, art tee” and he pulled out 4 stacks of some of the wildest tees I’ve ever seen. He basically said “I keep this stuff in the back because it just sits, it takes a special kind of person to buy these kinds of things and they just sit on the wall” The store even had some pretty sick “mids” or just general rack tees. An awesome Frank Lloyd Wright tee, Matisse tees, and even some cool masters stuff (it was Atlanta after all) The back has seen better days, but you can make out the text still and the font is insane. I always try to avoid buying online because it’s more about (cliche voice) the journey and the people you meet along the way. I’m not a reseller, I don’t have a storefront or a Depop, etc. I just like to buy because it keeps me young I guess (mid-life crisis) and there is no better feeling than buying a shirt that fits you perfectly. amazing single stitch tees with no flaws other than an incredible fade. If you have never listened to this band before, I urge you to drop what you are doing and listen immediately. Their second album I mentioned earlier was a “flop” still bangs, I spin it on wax all the time. Some of my favorite songs are “just sit there”, “trapped”, “live to work”, “initial shock” and their black sabbath cover of “sweet leaf”. '

      itemCopy: 'It\'s 2009 and you just watched "500 Days of Summer" and you\'re thinking, damn, we are at the height of the indie craze, Portland Oregon obsessed, Thick black frame glasses zeitgeist, this shit rocks! You hear "There is a light that never goes out" by The Smiths and instantly go to your nearest coffee shop (was this pre third wave?) and ask the girl with the slouchy beanie and Kimya Dawson tee out. That movie was probably a lot of peoples first introduction to the smiths, It certainly was mine. Im pretty sure everyone hated the smiths in the hardcore community until someone from cold world wore a smiths tee, after that, it was the green light for collectors (my memory could be off, but i remember hearing this somewhere). Rank is probably my favorite album, although not a studio album, it has my favorite recordings of my favorite songs on it. Cemetary Gates, Vicar In a Tutu, The Boy With The Thorn In His Side, etc. There\'s something about it, akin to the first warm day of spring or that initial crisp breeze of autumn, when you\'re cruising down the country road with your best friends, windows down, and "This Charming Man" blaring from the speakers. It\'s in those moments that you suddenly grasp how these cherished times will gradually fade away as life\'s bigger events unfold. People get married, take job opportunities in far-off places, or sometimes there\'s a falling out. Life is fleeting, and it\'s essential to stay grounded and fully embrace the present. These are the moments you can sum up in a few words like "scenic drive with the bros and great tunes," yet they resonate emotionally like a thousand words. Cherish them at all costs. Ok sorry for my soapbox, Text someone you love them and go buy a fire ass jawn!'
