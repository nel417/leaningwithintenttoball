export const bjorkCopy = 'I\'m on vacation and on the hunt for some new tees as per usual. I\'m about halfway through my trip, I have been striking out on vintage and I said to my self "Im going to pull up to Luke\'s and maybe find some old designer or archive"<br><br>I saw this on the wall and thought it was a crazy shirt. It was thrifted in Costa Rica and features a purple blank. I had a Sundays tee that was also on a purple blank when the original blank was a light heather gray. I don\'t know if it has anything to do with the geographic location (i.e., some countries/regions have different blanks), they ran out of blanks and had to do a rush order, or if it came from bootleggers outside the venue.<br><br> From what I can see, it seems like on the Homogenic tour they released the Joga shirt in dark blue/navy, on Murina. I am not sure about the countries those were released in, but it appears that they are printed on a Fruit of the Loom heavy tag in Japan. Bj√∂rk played in South America during the Homogenic tour and played Brazil, Chile, and Argentina. My suspicion is that this is probably 51% parking lot tee, as licensed merchandise costs an arm and a leg, or 49% official, and those were the only blanks they had. How it got to Costa Rica? Who Knows. <br><br> While doing research, the logo is a little bit uncentered and drifts to the left (to the right when wearing), and looks identical to some of the navy blue ones on Murina that are tagged medium. (This is a Best by Fruit of the Loom, and fits like an extra-medium if that makes sense) and when you get into XL territory, the logo looks double this on larger tees (some of the Japan ones). I currently do not see any licensing on any of the shirts. Researching is fun; it\'s one of my favorite parts of vintage and collecting. This shirt is insane nonetheless, and I\'m glad to own it. <br><br>A lot of my favorite songs are on Debut, and I am a huge Sugarcubes fan. But some of my favorite songs are "Human Behavior," "Aeroplane," "Joga," and "Pluto." If you have any information on this tee, reach out, and I\'d love to chop it up with you and learn more'
