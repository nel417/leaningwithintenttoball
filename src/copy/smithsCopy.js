export const smithsCopy = 'It\'s 2009, and you just watched "500 Days of Summer," and you\'re thinking, "Damn, we are at the height of the indie craze, Portland, Oregon obsessed, thick black frame glasses zeitgeist, this shit rocks!" You hear "There is a light that never goes out" by The Smiths and instantly go to your nearest coffee shop (was this pre-third wave?) and ask the girl with the slouchy beanie and Kimya Dawson tee out. That movie was probably a lot of people\'s first introduction to The Smiths; it certainly was mine. <br><br> I\'m pretty sure everyone hated The Smiths in the hardcore community until someone from Cold World wore a Smiths tee; after that, it was the green light for collectors (my memory could be off, but I remember hearing this somewhere). "Rank" is probably my favorite album, although not a studio album; it has my favorite recordings of my favorite songs on it. "Cemetery Gates," "Vicar In a Tutu," "The Boy With The Thorn In His Side," etc. There\'s something about it, akin to the first warm day of spring or that initial crisp breeze of autumn, when you\'re cruising down the country road with your best friends, windows down, and "This Charming Man" blaring from the speakers.<br><br> It\'s in those moments that you suddenly grasp how these cherished times will gradually fade away as life\'s bigger events unfold. People get married, take job opportunities in far-off places, or sometimes there\'s a falling out. Life is fleeting, and it\'s essential to stay grounded and fully embrace the present. These are the moments you can sum up in a few words like "scenic drive with the bros and great tunes," yet they resonate emotionally like a thousand words. Cherish them at all costs. Okay, sorry for my soapbox. Text someone you love them and go buy a fire-ass jawn!'
