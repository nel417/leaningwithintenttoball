export const alisonCopy = 'A shirt that I have been searching for ages has finally come into my possession. I\'ve been a huge fan of this band for a while and didn\'t think these existed. I was originally on the hunt for a CD or some sort of physical media, and this popped up in my eBay feed, so I had to pull the trigger immediately.<br><br> Alisons Halo is a shoegaze/dreampop outfit from Tempe, AZ. Some might say they are underrated or heavily overlooked. Many of the bands during this time were from across the pond, so I\'m not sure if it was their location and timing (early for the United States, late for Europe? I\'m going off the shoegaze calendar, not the Gregorian calendar!), but their music is some of the most lush and ethereal I have ever listened to.<br><br> It\'s like one giant dream. "Eyedazzler" is the album that most people find first and listen to; it\'s an amazing collection of singles and doesn\'t really have a defined direction. I enjoy the fuzz and the walls it has; it sounds very full. It\'s music to get lost in the woods to, introspection music, and music for thinking and reminiscing. <br><br>My favorite song is "Torn." Every time I listen to it, I think about a lot of "what ifs" and just reflect for a moment. Everything happens for a reason, kind of like the pregame before the link and build activation. You play this song, think about all the awful shirts you printed, realize you did wrong, and come back next season with the most fire designs that sell out instantly. It\'s good to think sometimes. I feel like I think and reflect too much sometimes.'
