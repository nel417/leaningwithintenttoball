export const crumbsuckersCopy = 'I\'ve always been a hardcore head, but unfortunately, I got into vintage late. Back in the day, we called them "OG\'s" instead of vintage. "Just got an OG integrity shirt" not "just got a vintage integrity shirt." I\'ve been around it since the dawn of time; all my friends had all the insane victory sleeve prints, test prints, "good" Youth of Today tees, but I could never cop at the time. Now that the bag has hit, and I have become a corndog (a weenie with bread), there\'s one shirt that\'s always been on my mind: any Crumbsuckers tee. Crumbsuckers were a crossover band from New York with Chris from Krakdown on vocals. <br> <br>Very riff-heavy, mad solos, and very moshy. They cemented themselves as instant classics by dominating the CBGB matinee scene. Unfortunately, after their second studio album "Beast on My Back," things went south, and they broke up not too long after. They have played multiple reunions, their most recent being the 2015 Black n Blue Bowl; they sound immaculate. I was recently on a trip to Atlanta to see a long-time friend, and I was having a hard time finding a vintage shop outside of a "general L train rip," etc. I went to one store, walked out, and walked up into the walkway/alley/promenade, and we saw a "curated vintage sign" and walked in, and my day was about to do a 180 from not being able to find anything crazy. I was able to grab the Life of Dreams tee with an immaculate fade. It features artwork by Sean Taggart, the one behind all the crazy CBGB flyers and an artwork contributor to bands such as Cro-Mags, Underdog, and Carnivore. <br> <br> It\'s very hard to find niche music tees at stores. Most of the time it\'s either eBay or pray to the bin gods you can pull something. The previous store had a Snapcase tee for like $249, yikes. Being able to find something like this in a storefront is pretty sick because the guy asked me what I\'m into, and I basically said "hardcore, shoegaze, skate, art tee," and he pulled out four stacks of some of the wildest tees I\'ve ever seen. He basically said, "I keep this stuff in the back because it just sits, it takes a special kind of person to buy these kinds of things, and they just sit on the wall." The store even had some pretty sick "mids" or just general rack tees. An awesome Frank Lloyd Wright tee, Matisse tees, and even some cool masters stuff (it was Atlanta after all).<br> <br> The back has seen better days, but you can make out the text still, and the font is insane. I always try to avoid buying online because it\'s more about (cliche voice) the journey and the people you meet along the way. I\'m not a reseller; I don\'t have a storefront or a Depop, etc. I just like to buy because it keeps me young, I guess (mid-life crisis), and there is no better feeling than buying a shirt that fits you perfectly. Amazing single-stitch tees with no flaws other than an incredible fade. If you have never listened to this band before, I urge you to drop what you are doing and listen immediately. Their second album I mentioned earlier was a "flop" still bangs; I spin it on wax all the time. Some of my favorite songs are "just sit there," "trapped," "live to work," "initial shock," and their Black Sabbath cover of "sweet leaf."'
